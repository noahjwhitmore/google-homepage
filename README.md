This project is being created as I follow the curriculum of the The Odin Project.

[Final Result](https://noahjwhitmore.github.io/google-homepage/)

It's been a pretty good learning tool for Git and GitHub. I think the result ended up pretty well.

Unless this project comes back up in the Odin curriculum, I probably won't really ever come back to it. Haha!
